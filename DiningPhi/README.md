### Dining Philosophers Problem, Kommenda & Raci

 
When multiple users want to get information from 2 tables simultaneously (assuming tables get locked while they're being accessed). In this example, the forks are the tables, the spaghetti is the information and the philosophers are the users.

So when the user accesses a table, they block it for the others and when they try to access a second table it is already blocked. They block each other off from reading anything.
